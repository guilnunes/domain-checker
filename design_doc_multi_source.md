# Multi-Source Domain Availability Checker - Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the design for enhancing the domain availability checker with a multi-source approach that combines WHOIS data with registrar API data (primarily GoDaddy) to provide more accurate domain availability results.

## Problem Statement
The current implementation relies solely on WHOIS queries, which has been found to produce false negatives - domains reported as unavailable when they are actually available for purchase through registrars like GoDaddy. This discrepancy reduces the reliability of the application.

## Proposed Solution
Implement a multi-source domain checking system that:
1. Queries multiple data sources for each domain
2. Combines and reconciles results using a weighted decision algorithm
3. Provides more accurate availability information to users
4. Clearly indicates the confidence level of each result

## Architecture

### High-Level Components
1. **Core Domain Checker** - Orchestrates the checking process across multiple sources
2. **Source Providers** - Pluggable modules for different availability data sources:
   - WHOIS Provider (existing)
   - GoDaddy API Provider (new)
   - Additional Registrar Providers (extensible)
3. **Result Reconciliation Engine** - Combines and weighs results from different sources
4. **Enhanced UI** - Displays multi-source results with confidence indicators

### Data Flow
1. User submits brand names and selects TLDs
2. For each domain:
   - Core Domain Checker dispatches parallel checks to all available sources
   - Each source provider returns availability status and confidence score
   - Result Reconciliation Engine combines results using weighted algorithm
   - Final availability determination is made with confidence level
3. Results are displayed to user with source information and confidence indicators

### Source Provider Interface
Each source provider will implement a common interface:
```python
class DomainSourceProvider:
    def check_availability(self, domain):
        """
        Check domain availability from this source
        
        Args:
            domain (str): The domain to check
            
        Returns:
            dict: {
                'available': bool,  # True if available, False if not
                'confidence': float,  # 0.0-1.0 confidence score
                'source': str,  # Name of the source
                'details': dict,  # Source-specific details
                'error': str  # Error message if any, None otherwise
            }
        """
        pass
```

### GoDaddy API Integration
The GoDaddy API Provider will:
1. Connect to GoDaddy's Domain Availability API
2. Handle authentication and rate limiting
3. Process API responses into standardized availability results
4. Provide high-confidence availability determinations

### Result Reconciliation Algorithm
The algorithm for combining results will:
1. Assign weights to different sources (GoDaddy API > WHOIS)
2. Consider confidence scores from each source
3. Handle conflicting results with preference to registrar APIs
4. Generate a final availability determination with confidence level

```
if any source reports error:
    mark as "unknown" with low confidence
else if all sources agree:
    use that result with high confidence
else if registrar API and WHOIS disagree:
    prefer registrar API result with medium confidence
else:
    use majority result with medium confidence
```

### Enhanced UI Components
1. **Availability Indicator** - Shows availability with confidence level
2. **Source Information** - Displays which sources were checked
3. **Confidence Meter** - Visual indicator of result confidence
4. **Direct Verification Links** - Links to check directly on registrar sites

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Architecture
1. Implement Source Provider interface
2. Refactor existing WHOIS checker to implement this interface
3. Create the Core Domain Checker orchestration layer
4. Implement basic Result Reconciliation Engine

### Phase 2: GoDaddy API Integration
1. Create GoDaddy API client
2. Implement GoDaddy Source Provider
3. Handle authentication, rate limiting, and error cases
4. Test with sample domains

### Phase 3: UI Enhancements
1. Update frontend to display multi-source results
2. Add confidence indicators
3. Implement source information display
4. Add direct verification links

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
1. Test with domains known to have WHOIS/registrar discrepancies
2. Refine reconciliation algorithm based on results
3. Optimize performance for parallel checking

## Technical Considerations

### GoDaddy API Requirements
- API Key and Secret required for authentication
- Rate limits: Need to handle potential throttling
- Account requirements: May need account with 50+ domains (based on search results)
- Fallback mechanism if API is unavailable

### Error Handling
- Network errors during API calls
- Authentication/authorization failures
- Rate limiting responses
- Timeout handling
- Graceful degradation to WHOIS-only when APIs unavailable

### Performance Optimization
- Parallel API requests to multiple sources
- Caching of results to reduce redundant checks
- Prioritization of sources based on reliability and speed

### Security Considerations
- Secure storage of API credentials
- No exposure of credentials in client-side code
- Proper error handling to prevent information leakage

## Future Extensions
1. Additional registrar API integrations (Namecheap, Name.com, etc.)
2. Machine learning model to improve reconciliation algorithm
3. User feedback mechanism to improve accuracy over time
4. Premium features for bulk checking with higher accuracy

## Conclusion
This multi-source approach will significantly improve the accuracy of domain availability checking by combining traditional WHOIS data with authoritative registrar API data. The modular architecture allows for future expansion to additional data sources while providing users with more reliable results and confidence indicators.
